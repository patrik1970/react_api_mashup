## React Movie Seach App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a API-mashup built in React.<br>
For this API-mashup have I used:<br>
[OmDbs Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)<br>
[YouTubes API V3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)

## Up and running

Download the project by clone it.

### `npm install`

Install the node modules.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
